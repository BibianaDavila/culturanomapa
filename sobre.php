						<h1>O projeto</h1>
						<p>
							A iniciativa "Cultura no Mapa", criada para a disciplina de Design Editorial da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, ainda está em desenvolvimento. Com o objetivo de reunir os centros culturais de Porto Alegre em apenas um endereço, os locais cadastrados no projeto até então estão divididos entre museus, salas de cinema e teatros. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Baseado na plataforma Google Maps, basta clicar sobre o ícone de qualquer um dos pontos cadastrados para visualizar mais informações a seu respeito, como imagens, telefone de contato, website e horário de funcionamento — os dados estão de acordo com o conteúdo cadastrado no próprio Google.
						</p>
						<p>
							O código e o design são responsabilidade de Bibiana da Costa Davila. Os ícones são da Font Awesome — exceto as musas abaixo, que são parte do Noun Project. É possível conferir <a href="https://github.com/BibianaDavila">o projeto do Mapa completo no GitHub</a> ou entrar em contato via <a href="mailto:davila.bibiana@gmail.com">davila.bibiana@gmail.com</a>.
